# Canadian_Hurricane_Impact
 This is a repository to showcase the impacts hurricanes have within Canada, along with their observations. The goal of this project is to aggregate data from all across different organizations and sources into one compact resource. 

# Current Data Available.
Currently within the available database there is data from CoCoRaHS, Iowa State Mesonet, and Environment and Climate Change Canada using both of their Open-Data applications. The data is only set to between 2012 and 2021, the reason for 2012 is due to that being the date in which CoCoRaHS became available within Canada and 2021 is due to the 2022 season not being finished. 

- CoCoRaHS Data
- METARs from IEM. 
- Climate station reports from ECCC. 

# Additions soon coming. 
Over the coming months there are additions I would like to make to this, some of which being: 
- Adding radar images. 
- Adding tracks from both the NHC and CHC. 
- Adding impact images from social media. 
- Adding finanical impacts for each event.
